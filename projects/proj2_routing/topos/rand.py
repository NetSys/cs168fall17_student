    Creates a random fully-connected (single component) topology.

    The topology will have *switches* switches, and *hosts* hosts.
    The switches will be connected by *links* links unless *tree*, in which
    case the topology will be a tree (and therefore have *switches* - 1 links).
    That's all not counting the extra *hosts* links which connect hosts to
    switches.
    Invalid numbers of links should just be clamped to the legal range;
    among other things, this means that setting links=0 will give you a tree.
    If *multiple_hosts* is True, hosts are allocated to switches entirely at
    random, so a switch may have multiple hosts.  If it's False, each switch
    will have at most one host (so *hosts* better be <= *switches*).
