# Understanding the Simulator Commandline

The typical way to start the simulator is using `simulator.py`. This
starts up a number of “modules” and then begins simulation. Modules are
Python scripts which typically implement a `launch` function. A module
might, for example, create a topology or run an automated test.

`simulator.py` itself may take commandline options. These come at the
very beginning of the commandline and are prefixed with two dashes
(e.g., `--foo`). Commandline arguments without the two dashes specify the
names of modules to be loaded (in the order in which they’ll be loaded).
Modules can also have options (again prefixed with two dashes). So a
complete commandline might look like:

    $ python simulator.py --sim-opt1=value --no-sim-opt2 mod1 --mod1-opt1=value mod2 --mod2-opt1

Here we’re passing two options to the simulator, and loading two
modules, each of which are getting one option. Note that normally
options are of the form `--name=value`. For boolean options, you just do
`--name` or `--no-name`.

Module options are automatically passed to the module’s `launch`
function.

# Micro-Tutorial

Let’s try a quick introduction. Since you haven’t implemented a router
yet, we’ll use the simple example Hub entity which just takes every
packet it receives and sends it on every other link.

We’ll use the `topos.rand` module to create a random topology with four
switches/routers (hubs in this case), four hosts (one per switch), and
three links. Since there are four switches and only three links, this
topology is guaranteed not to have loops, which is important because
hubs don’t do so well on topologies with loops!

    $ python simulator.py --default-switch-type=examples.hub topos.rand --switches=4 --links=3 \
      --hosts=4 --no-multiple-hosts

Executing the above should give some informational text (including a
listing of the names of each node in the topology -- `h1`-`h4` and
`s1`-`s4` in this case) and then a Python interpreter in the terminal.
If you want to try the NetVis GUI (see the section later), you can
start it now. If the simulator doesn’t start up, the most common reason
results in a traceback for an `Address already in use` exception. If
this occurs, it’s likely that someone else is running the simulator on
the same machine (or you have an old instance running which you should
quit!). This is going to make using the log viewer and NetVis (described
in later sections) impossible without hacking them a little, which may
or may not be a problem depending on whether you want to use them. For
now, add the `--no-remote-interface` option.

From the interpreter in the terminal, you can run arbitrary Python code,
inspect and manipulate the simulation, interact with the
Entities (switches, hosts, etc.), and get help on many aspects of
the simulator. For example `help(topos.rand)` will show information on
the random topology generator, and `help(h1)` will give help on the
first host node.

Let’s start the simulation (it’s initially in a suspended state unless
you pass `--start` on the commandline) and send a ping between two of the
hosts:

    >>> start() # make sure not to forget this!
    >>> h1.ping(h2)

(If you’re using NetVis, you could also have sent the ping by selecting
`h1`, pressing “a”, selecting `h2`, pressing “b”, and then pressing
“p”.)

After a short wait, the ping packets will start hitting the other hosts;
when this happens, a log message is printed. Since we’re using a hub,
the packet will show up at *all* other hosts -- when it shows up at the
wrong one, the log message will say so. Hosts, by default, respond to
pings by sending back a pong. These will also show up in the console.

So why don’t we want to use a bunch of hubs on a topology with loops?
Because the packets just keep looping around. You can try it yourself --
press Ctrl-D (or type `exit()`) to exit the simulator, and then re-run
it passing `--links=4` which ensures there’s a loop. Try the ping test
again. When you get bored, exit the simulator again. Note that the
simulator automatically gives us a TTL -- any packet will only be
forwarded up to some maximum number of times -- or the amount of looping
and packet replication would be even greater!

By modifying the commandline above to use `learning_switch` rather than
`examples.hub`, you can get started working on your own learning switch.

# NetVis: The GUI

The simulator includes a graphical user interface called NetVis. You don’t need
to use it in order to successfully complete the project, but it will probably be
very helpful.

NetVis is a visualization and interactivity tool for the network
simulator. It is written using Processing, which is basically a
framework for writing visualization tools in Java (with some nice
shortcuts). Here's how to get NetVis running:

1.  [Download Processing](https://processing.org/download/?processing) for your
    platform, install it, and run it.

2.  Install the [ControlP5](https://github.com/sojamo/controlp5) library from
    within Processing: go to Sketch → Import Library... → Add Library..., search
    for ControlP5, and click Install.

3.  If you don't have the the JDK, install it.

4.  Compile the `json` library included with NetVis by running
    `netvis/code/json/src/build.sh` and answer the prompt.
    - **Note**: It may ask for the location of `rt.jar`, which can be found in the `processing` directory you downloaded in Step 1.
      Provide an **absolute** path to the prompt (e.g. `/Users/gabe/...` or `/home/gabe/...` instead of `~/...`)

5.  In Processing, go to File → Open..., and open up `netvis/NetVis.pde`.
    - **Note**: If you're seeing an error such as "No module named Graph", try starting Processing from inside the `netvis` folder.

6.  Start `simulator.py` from the command line as described above.

7.  In Processing, press the play button to run NetVis. You should see a purple
    window with your topology!

Entities, links, and packets in your simulator should show up automatically in
NetVis. Entities generally try to position themselves automatically. You can
also “pin” them in place, by clicking the attached bubble. You can zoom in and
out, as well as altering some of the layout forces using options in the “layout”
panel (click on it to open it). The “info” panel can be set from within the
simulator, so you can populate it with helpful debugging info or whatever you
like. If you open it up, it should start out with some usage tips.
You can stop and start simulator.py as many times as you want without restarting Processing.

See `examples/megaping.py` for an example of some advanced NetVis
functionality.

# Implementing Your Own Distance Vector Router

When you’ve mastered your learning switch, you can get started on your
distance vector router. First things first, let’s start by changing the
commandline we’ll use for the simulator. Rather than using a random
topology, let’s start with something very simple -- like a simple linear
topology. We can use the `topos.linear` topology generator for that. As
your implementation matures, you can try some of the other topologies
we’ve included, or make your own with a Python script or using the
`.topo` file format loaded by `topos.loader`. We also want to make sure
to use your `DVRouter` class instead of the hub -- we’ve provided a
skeleton of this class in `dv_router.py`, which you can modify. So our
first commandline might look like:

    python simulator.py --default-switch-type=dv_router topos.linear

Once you’ve got that going, it’s up to you to implement distance vector
routing, by sending routes to neighbors, processing the ones they send
you, and listening for hosts to announce themselves with their discovery
messages. See the [assignment specification](spec.md) for more on all of this,
including things your router will be expected to do (and not do),
specific packet types you’ll have to deal with, and other tips. The
remainder of this section also touches on a few details.

## Implementing Entities

Objects that exist in the simulator are subclasses of the `Entity`
superclass (in `api.py`). These have a handful of utility functions, as
well as some empty functions that are called when various events occur.
You probably want to handle at least some of these events! For more help
try `help(api.Entity)` within the simulator. You might also want to peek
at `hub.py`, which is a simple `Entity` to get you started.

Your `DVRouter` should actually subclass a subclass of `Entity` -- the
`DVRouterBase` class. Basically this subclass just adds support for
timed updates and a flag for whether the router should send poison
routes or not. For reference, some important functions from `Entity` are
as follows (feel free to read the documentation/comments in
`dv_router.py`, poke around in the source or try `help(api.Entity)` and
`help(basics.DVRouterBase)` in the simulator for more information):

```python
class Entity(object):
    def handle_rx(self, packet, port):
        # Called by the framework when the Entity self receives a packet.
        # packet - a Packet (or subclass).
        # port - port number it arrived on.
        # You definitely want to override this method.

    def handle_link_up(self, port, latency):
        # Called by the framework when a link is attached to this Entity.
        # port - local port number associated with the link
        # latency - the latency of the attached link
        # You probably want to override this method.

    def handle_link_down(self, port):
        # Called by the framework when a link is unattached from this Entity.
        # port - local port number associated with the link
        # You probably want to override this method.

    def send(self, packet, port=None, flood=False):
        # Sends the packet out of a specific port or ports. If the packet's
        # src is None, it will be set automatically to the Entity self.
        # packet - a Packet (or subclass).
        # port - a numeric port number, or a list of port numbers.
        # flood - If True, the meaning of port is reversed - packets will
        #         be sent from all ports EXCEPT those listed.
        # Do not override this method.

    def log(self, format, *args):
        # Produces a log message
        # format - The log message as a Python format string
        # args - Arguments for the format string
        # Do not override this method.
```

## Sending Packets

Entities can send and receive packets. In the simulator, this means a
subclass of `Packet`. See `basics.Ping` for one such example, and see
`basics.BasicHost` to see an example of how it is used. You can tell
packet types apart using Python’s `isinstance()`, e.g.,
`if isinstance(packet, basics.Ping): ...`

Here are some highlights of the `Packet` superclass (as usual,
`help(api.Packet)` will tell you more):

```python
class Packet(object):
    self.src
    # Packets have a source address.
    # You generally don't need to set it yourself.  The "address" is actually a
    # reference to the sending Entity, though you shouldn't access its attributes!

    self.dst
    # Packets have a destination address.
    # In some cases, packets aren't routeable -- they aren't supposed to be
    # forwarded by one router to another.  These don't need destination addresses
    # and have the address set to None.  Otherwise, this is a reference to a
    # destination Entity.

    self.trace
    # A list of every Entity that has handled the packet previously. This is
    # here to help you debug. Don't use this information in your router logic.
```

Subclasses may add more attributes. Aside from the aforementioned `Ping`
subclass, you’ll also be very interested in the `RoutePacket` and
`HostDiscoveryPacket` which are discussed in a bit more detail in the
assignment document.

## Other Useful Stuff

Other things which may be useful:

1.  `api.current_time()` returns the current time in seconds. This is
    useful to know when to time out routes, since you can’t really be
    sure how often `handle_timer` will be called.

2.  *Packets have colors* in the GUI. Pings default to random color
    outsides with whiteish inside. Pongs flip those so you can sort of
    see which pong went with which ping. Host discovery packets
    are yellow. Routes are magenta. If you want, you can control packet
    colors using the `inner_color` or `outer_color` attributes. Set them
    to a list containing `[redness, greenness, blueness, opacity]` where
    all values are between `0` and `1`.

# Experimenting with Topologies

The simulator comes with a few different topologies and topology
generators in the `topos` package. You can modify these, write your own
based on them, etc. The point is, your router should work on arbitrary
topologies, not just the ones we give you, so you might want to build
your own to test on and experiment with! Here we briefly cover how you
can go about this (besides just reading the code for the existing ones,
which isn’t that complex on the whole).

There are two basic ways of creating a topology. The first is
programmatically, by creating and linking entities. The second is by
creating a `.topo` topology file which is loaded by `topos.loader`
(which, internally, just does things the first way).

## Programmatic Topologies

The first step is simply creating some entities so that the simulator
can use them. You shouldn’t create the nodes using the normal Python
instance creation. Instead, use the `.create()` factory on `Entity`,
along the lines of:

    >>> MyNodeType.create('myNodeName')

That is, you **don’t** want to use normal Python object creation like:

    >>> x = MyNodeType() # Don’t do this

You can use the return value from `create` if you want, though (it
returns the new entity). You can also pass extra values into `create`,
and they get passed to the constructor (`__init__`), but be careful with
this feature, since we will initialize your routers with no additional
arguments!

New entities should be globally available, so you can do:

    >>> x = MyNodeType.create('myNodeName') >>> print myNodeName, x

which will show the new `Entity` twice.

To link this to some other Entity:

    >>> myNodeName.linkTo(someOtherNode)

Optionally, you may pass in a latency for the link to override the
default of one second:

    >>> myNodeName.linkTo(someOtherNode, latency=0.5)

You can also `.unlinkTo()` it, or disconnect it from everything:

    >>> myNodeName.disconnect()

Note that you can use this same functionality to experiment with and
interactively test your code live in the simulator.

## Topo Files

There’s a simple topology file format which is read by `topos.loader`.

The file format consists of lines beginning with `h` (for hosts), `s`
(for switches), or `l` (links). Host and switch lines specify a node
name. Link lines specify the two nodes to link and optionally a link
latency.

You load these by using the `topos.loader` module with the `--filename`
option on the commandline, like so:

    $ python simulator.py topos.loader --filename=foo.topo

An example topology file looks like this (check the topos directory for
more):

    # A triangular thing
    h A
    h B
    h C
    s s1
    s s2
    s s3
    l A s1
    l B s2
    l C s3
    l s1 s2 0.5
    l s2 s3 0.5
    l s3 s1

# Building Your Own Tests

It will probably help to test your code. You can do this interactively using the
Python console (using the programmatic topology manipulation features mentioned
above) or through the NetVis GUI. We have also included a number of automated
tests in the `tests` directory. These tests don't cover all the requirements for
your router, but they're a good start.

You can run all the tests using `python test_suite.py`. This will run each test
using virtual time so the full test suite completes quickly. If a test fails, it
will print the command you can use to rerun just that test interactively.

The first included test is `test_simple.py`, which just creates a small topology
and sends a couple pings, making sure the right number of pings arrive. Let’s
try it using the hub:

    $ python simulator.py --no-interactive --default-switch-type=examples.hub examples.test_simple

Note that we use `--no-interactive` to start the simulator without the
Python console for the purposes of testing.

Running this test with the hub should fail because packets show up where
they shouldn’t. Your distance vector router should pass it!

The `test_failure` test can be run similarly. It sends a packet, fails a
link, sends another packet, and expects both packets to arrive at the
destination. It’ll also fail with the hub.

Using the code and design of these tests for inspiration, you can
construct your own.

# The Log Viewers

Log messages are generally sent to the terminal from which the simulator
is run. If you are using the interactive interpreter for debugging or
experimentation, this can be somewhat irritating. You can disable these
by passing `--no-console-log` on the simulator commandline. Note that
this needs to be *before* you list any modules, or this will be
interpreted as an option for the preceeding module (as discussed in the
section on the commandline above).

Of course, those log messages can be really quite helpful, and you might
want to see them. To rectify this, the simulator comes with two
standalone log viewers: `tools/logviewer.py` and
`tools/console_logviewer.py`. The former is a GUI application which
opens a new window, and you can run it in the background before starting
the simulator:

    $ python tools/logviewer.py &

The latter is a plain old console application, which you can run in a
separate console (e.g., a new Terminal window on a Mac or a new ssh
session if you’re running the simulator on a remote machine).
